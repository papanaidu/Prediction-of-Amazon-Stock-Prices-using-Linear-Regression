# Amazon Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Amazon stock prices based on historical commodity prices and volumes using a linear regression model. The project covers the entire machine learning workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values by filling them with the mean of their respective columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the distribution of `Amazon_Price` and analyzed relationships with other features through scatter plots and a correlation matrix.
- **Feature Engineering**: Standardized features using `StandardScaler` and selected relevant features based on correlation analysis.
- **Model Development**: Implemented a linear regression model with an 80-20 split for training and testing datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), along with 5-fold cross-validation.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyzed and visualized model coefficients to identify influential features affecting `Amazon_Price`.
- **Documentation**: Compiled the project into a Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations and prepared a summary for submission.
